# Project manager  
 
  
  This is a simple program I made to track various tasks/projects with deadlines in university. It works by prioritizing the projects that you have done less progress on compared to the time left you have for the deadline.
  
  Priority goes from 1 (highest) to 9 (lowest) in accordance with the calcurse todos-priority system
